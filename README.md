# Manjulaâ€™s Projects Portfolio

This repository contains selected academic and research projects in **Communication Systems, Machine Learning in wireless**.  

## ðŸ“Œ ML in wireless Projects
- **Automatic Modulation Classification (Deep Learning)**  
  Generated a custom dataset of raw I/Q samples in Python for BPSK, QPSK, and 16-QAM under â€“5 to 20 dB SNR.Implemented a hybrid CNNâ€“Transformer (PCTNet) achieving 95.6% accuracy, with significant improvement in QPSK and 16-QAM classification over baseline CNNs.  

- **Network Intrusion Detection (ML)**  
  Developed ML-based models using CNNs and DNNs for cyber-attack classification using NSL-KDD Cup dataset. Achieved 99.8% accuracy with DNN and 99.5% with CNN, as dense fully connected layers proved more effective for tabular NSL-KDD features than convolution filters. 

## ðŸ“¡ Communication Systems Projects
- **Reactive Jamming Mitigation**  
  Simulated a cooperative communication system in MATLAB using OOK at victim and M-QAM at helper with Joint MAP decoding. Plotted BER vs. Î± (energy division factor) for varying SNRs (25â€“35 dB) and different numbers of receiver antennas, showing improved performance with optimized Î± and higher antenna counts.
  
- **OFDM System on SDR**  
Implemented OFDM transmitter/receiver modules on GNU Radio SDR, evaluating FFT size impact on PAPR, channel selectivity, and cyclic prefix effect on ISI mitigation.Simulated OFDM in MATLAB, analyzing BER of BPSK/QPSK under frequency-selective channels with different Power Delay Profiles (PDP)  

-**FM Receiver and Digital Communication System**
 Designed and implemented an FM radio receiver using GNU Radio SDR with tunable frequencies across the FM band.Built a digital communication chain to transmit and receive an image file, demonstrating modulation, transmission, demodulation, and recovery of the image at the receiver end.
